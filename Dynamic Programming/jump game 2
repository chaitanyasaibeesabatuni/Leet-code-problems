#### similarly jump game but here we have to find the minimum number of steps to reach the last position .

#### problem statement: https://leetcode.com/problems/jump-game-ii/

#### Logic : We have to use the sliding window algo to that so we have to pointers l and r each time we check the farthest point to the pointers so 

##### sliding window method 

def func(l):
  l=r=0
  res=0
  while r<len(l)-1:
    maxpoint=0
    for i in range(l,r+1):
      maxpoint=max(maxpoint,i+l[i])
    l=r+1
    r=maxpoint
    res+=1
  return res
 
l=list(map(int,input().split())
print(func(l))
