# problem statement :    https://leetcode.com/problems/house-robber/

#Logic : we have to select the first element and leave the adjacent and find the max element of the remaining and we have to traverse the entire string so that's form an 
#maximum at the last element.

#problem solution :

houses=list(map(int,input().split()))
rob1,rob2=0,0

for i in houses:
    temp=max(rob1+i,rob2)
    rob1=rob2
    rob2=temp
print(rob2)
