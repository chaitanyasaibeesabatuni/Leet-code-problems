#### Solution :


s=input()
n=len(s)
#intializing the best base case if we crosses the len of the string we have to return zero
dp={n:1}
#bottom up approach
for i in range(n-1,-1,-1):
    #if zero occurs we have to insert zero so it was bad case in our problem
    #logic for considering single element
    if s[i]=="0":
        dp[i]=0
    else:
        dp[i]=dp[i+1]
    #for two elements :
    if i+1<n and (s[i]=="1" or s[i]=="2" and s[i+1] in "0123456"):
        #we are adding because we have consider the two elements and single element test case also so that's why we are adding
        dp[i]+=dp[i+2]
print(dp[0])
