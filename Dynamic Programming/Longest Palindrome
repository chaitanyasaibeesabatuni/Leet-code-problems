##### LOGIC:
### here we're a checking the palindromes for two cases one for even palindromes and other for odd palindromes and we just selecting one element in the string and moving 
### opposite direction towards the ends of the string with similarly check both pointers are equal or not if equal append it to the string else leave it, similary
### we gonna check the size of the palindromes if it is greater than the previous we have to update it else we gonna leave it as it is ....
